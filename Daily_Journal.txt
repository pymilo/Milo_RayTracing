The simulation has a bugg we want to fix. It consists in showing linear spatial gaps on the ghost-ray pattern for far
off-axis sources (~20 or ~30 arcmin).

The plan is to look at the cross-section of the incident rays at especific locations along the optical path. e.g.
at the module pupil, at the first hit of every ray.

So far I have tested that cross-section at the front of the optics for an on-axis source. The work was saved in the python3
notebook: "/Source_Debuging_00.ipynb".

Small problem found: The inner blocker has the wrong dimension. An
issue was created in the FOXSI-Github repository and assigned to
myself to fix it once I get the real values from Patrick (Marshall).
Patrick already responded saying he will give me those number early
next week. Fro now we could take some numbers out of the CAD drawings.

* Created a notebook called Source_Debuging_01.ipynb that contains
  tests that pass rays through the module and plot the cross-section.
